# Text2Hash (MD5)
 is a simple C# project that implements the MD5 hashing algorithm from scratch. This tool is used to generate MD5 hashes for input of strings.

Features
MD5 Hash Generation: Convert text or files into their corresponding MD5 hash values.

Simple Interface: Easy-to-use command line interface to quickly generate MD5 hashes.

Requirements
.NET Core / .NET Framework: This project is compatible with .NET Core 3.1 or higher, and .NET Framework 4.0 or higher.

C# Environment: A C# development environment to build or modify the project, such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.


How it Works
This project implements the MD5 hashing algorithm step-by-step, including:

Padding: The input data is padded to ensure its length is a multiple of 512 bits.

Initialization: MD5 initializes four 32-bit variables with specific values.

Processing Blocks: The input is processed in blocks of 512 bits, applying the MD5-specific transformations.

Output: The final MD5 hash is generated by combining the results of all processed blocks.
